# Project 1: Geo Location Matching

This project solves the problem of matching GPS coordinates between two arrays. For each point in the first array, the closest point from the second array is identified using the Haversine formula.

## Features
- Calculates the great-circle distance between two GPS coordinates.
- Matches points from the first array to their nearest neighbors in the second array.
- Outputs the closest point and its distance.
